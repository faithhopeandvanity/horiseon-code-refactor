# horiseon-code-refactor
My first piece of homework!

This is a 'refactoring' project; the idea is that I am to rewrite existing code to make it more functional and more attractive to the user.

This entailed using CSS to make the webpage layout look like a provided guide, including ascribing the correct fonts, giving elements the correct colour and putting image elements in the correct order. 

Also, all image elements have to have alt text to help with accessibility and ensure that an idea of the image's content is provided should the image fail to load.
